# Google Calendar Recursive Events Deletion (GC-RED)
# Date Exclusion Branch (**HALTED**)

## why this is halted

In the middle coding this branch i got a sudden realization, i guess one could say it was a reality check. This scope is way too big for me right now, i plan to make this project as a way to pass the time for summer break but now my summer break is almost ended and this project doesn't seem like it would end any time soon. So i decided that the core part of this project (the deletion part) would be the part that would stay and maybe ill also add some improvements, but this branch will be halted indefinitely.

TL;DR this branch will be indefinitely halted

GC-RED removes the events from the dates you've provided.
This program's sole reason for existing is to remove events.
Nothing more, nothing less.

## Why

Have you ever wanted to delete multiple events from
your calendar in only specific dates? But don't want to
manually remove them one-by-one? This program was specifically made to
automate doing this oddly specific task.
