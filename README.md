# Google Calendar Recursive Events Deletion (GC-RED)

GC-RED removes the events from the dates you've provided.
This program's sole reason for existing is to remove events.
Nothing more, nothing less.

## Why

Have you ever wanted to delete multiple events from
your calendar in only specific dates? But don't want to
remove them one-by-one? This program was specifically made to
automate doing this oddly specific task.
